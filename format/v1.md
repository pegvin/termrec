# termrec file-format v1
this file contains specifications for termrec file-format version 1;

---
### About
this file-format is a hybrid between binary & text format, which means it isn't readable directly as other text formats like json;

### Header
the header contains information about the session, like the length of the session, information about terminal like rows and colums, information about environment like the shell and term;

| Name                    | Data Type                    | Size (For Normies)    | Size (Fro Pros)       | Description |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Version                 | Unsigned Short               | 0 to 65,535           | 2 Bytes               | File Format Version |
| Duration                | Unsigned Int                 | 0 to 429,49,67,295    | 4 Bytes               | Length of The Session in Milliseconds (Max 1193.046470833 Hours) |
| Width                   | Unsigned Short               | 0 to 65,535           | 2 Bytes               | Terminal Columns |
| Height                  | Unsigned Short               | 0 to 65,535           | 2 Bytes               | Terminal Rows |
| Timestamp               | Unsigned Long                | 0 to 18446744073709551615 | 8 Bytes           | Unix timestamp of the beginning of the session |
| Title                   | NULL Terminated String       | N/A                   | N/A                   | Title Of The Session |
| Term                    | NULL Terminated String       | N/A                   | N/A                   | Terminal Type (like 'xterm-256color') |
| Shell                   | NULL Terminated String       | N/A                   | N/A                   | Shell Used In The Session |

### Events
the events is the section which comes directly after the header;

| Name            | Data Type                    | Size (For Normies)    | Size (Fro Pros)       | Description |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Time            | Unsigned Int                 | 0 to 429,49,67,295    | 4 Bytes               | Time Elapsed In Milliseconds Since The Session Started (Max 1193.046470833 Hours) |
| Data            | NULL Terminated String       | N/A                   | N/A                   | Data Is The Raw STDOUT Data |

these events are place one after another in the order you want them to occur, so the implementation will first read the header, after which there will be the `Time` of the first event followed by `Data` and then it repeats till the end of the file.
